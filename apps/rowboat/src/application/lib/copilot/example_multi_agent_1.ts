### Example 1: Meeting Assistant with Multi-Agent System

**User Request:**
Build me an assistant that can view my meetings on google calendar for a mentioned time period, do research on the participants and then give me a summary of the meeting sent to my email.

*call searchRelevantTools*
searchRelevantTools output:
<returns the tool data for Google Calendar, Tavily, and Gmail that can copy in your output when you need to add tools>

**Copilot Response:**

I'll break down your requirements into a multi-agent system and create the necessary agents and tools. Here's my plan:

**Plan & Agent Decomposition:**
1. Hub Agent: Orchestrates the workflow—asks for the time period, fetches meetings, and coordinates the process.
2. Meeting Fetch Agent: Gets meetings from Google Calendar for the specified time period.
3. Participant Research Agent: For each meeting, researches the participants using web search.
4. Meeting Summary Agent: Summarizes the meeting details and research.
5. Email Agent: Sends the summary to your email.

**Assumptions:**
- You want to specify the time period for meetings.
- You want research on all participants in each meeting.
- The summary should be sent to your email (which you'll provide).
- You want a single summary per meeting, sent as one email per meeting.

### Example 2: Google Doc Q&A Assistant

**User Request:**
Build me an assistant that looks at a google doc and answers users questions

*call searchRelevantTools*
searchRelevantTools output:
<returns the tool data for Google Docs that can copy in your output when you need to add tools>

**Copilot Response:**

I'll make the following changes to your workflow:

1. Add the "Get document by id" tool for retrieving the content of a Google Doc.
2. Replace the Example Agent with a single user-facing agent that:
   * Asks the user for the Google Doc ID and their question.
   * Uses the tool to fetch the document content.
   * Answers the user's question based only on the content of the fetched Google Doc (no RAG or external search).
   * Does not answer questions outside the content of the provided Google Doc.

Here are the changes:

I'm adding the "Get document by id" tool to fetch the content of a Google Doc by its ID:

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: tool
// name: Get document by id
{
  "change_description": "Added the 'Get document by id' tool to fetch the content of a Google Doc by its ID.",

      "toolkitSlug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "logo": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

I'm replacing the Example Agent with a user-facing agent that fetches a Google Doc by ID and answers questions based on its content:

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: edit

    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "outputVisibility": "user_facing",
    "controlType": "retain"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Once you review and apply the changes, you can try out a basic chat by providing a Google Doc ID and a question. I can then help you further refine the assistant if needed.

### Example 3: Tool Addition for LinkedIn and GitHub

**User Request:**
I want you to add tools that can be used to scrape a given linkedin URL, list users git hub repos, create a new github repo, and create or edit a file in that repository. Will make the agents later on

*call searchRelevantTools*
searchRelevantTools output:

### Example 4: Welcome Email Pipeline

**User Request:**
Create a pipeline that reads names + emails from a Google Sheet, personalizes a "welcome" email for each, and sends them via Gmail. The hub should just call the pipeline and report when done.

*call searchRelevantTools*
searchRelevantTools output:
<returns the tool data for Google Sheets "batch get" and Gmail "send email" that you can copy into your tool additions>

**Copilot Response:**

I'll set this up as a sequential pipeline with three pipeline agents:

1. **Step 1 (Fetch rows from Google Sheets)**
2. **Step 2 (Personalize email objects)**
3. **Step 3 (Send emails via Gmail)**

Then I'll create a **Pipeline Definition** that runs these steps in order, and update the Hub to call the pipeline and stop when it returns.

    "outputVisibility": "user_facing",
    "controlType": "retain"
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Example 5: Attendee Research & Slack Pipeline

**User Request:**
Build me an assistant that can do research on meeting attendees and send the findings to a Slack channel. And make sure it doesn't research me!

**Copilot Response:**

I can definitely build that. This will be a pipeline that first researches attendees and then sends the compiled summary to Slack.

To set this up correctly, I just need two pieces of information:

What is your email address (so I can exclude you from the research)?

What is the name of the Slack channel where you want the summary sent (e.g., general or meeting-prep)?

**User Response:**
My email is [USER_EMAIL] and the channel is [SLACK_CHANNEL].

**Copilot Response:**

Perfect. I'll set this up as a sequential pipeline with two main pipeline agents:

Step 1 (Research Agent) to look up each attendee.

Step 2 (Slack Send Agent) to post the summary.

Then I'll create a Pipeline Definition that runs these steps in order, and a Hub Agent to receive your requests and trigger the pipeline.

### 1. Add Required Tools

I'll add the necessary tools for web search and sending a Slack message.

\`\`\`copilot_change

    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Example 6: Automated Meeting Prep Pipeline

**User Request:**
I want to automate my meeting preparation. Can you build a workflow that, for every new calendar invite, researches the attendees, compiles a summary, and posts it to our #meeting-prep Slack channel?

**Copilot Response:**

Yes, I can build that for you. This is a perfect use case for a multi-step pipeline.

I'll create a workflow with a Hub agent that triggers a three-step pipeline:

Research Participants: Looks up each person in the invite.

Compile Summary: Consolidates the research into a clean summary.

Send to Slack: Posts the final summary to the #meeting-prep channel.

Here is the full setup.

---

### 1. Add Required Tools

First, I'll add the necessary tools for web research (Firecrawl) and sending Slack messages.

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: tool
// name: Search
{
  "change_description": "Add Firecrawl tool to perform a web search and scrape content from the top results.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
    "description": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "required": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    },
    "isComposio": true,
    "composioData": {
      "slug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "noAuth": false,
      "toolkitName": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "toolkitSlug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "logo": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: tool
// name: Send message
{
  "change_description": "Add Slack tool to post a message to a channel.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
    "description": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "required": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    },
    "isComposio": true,
    "composioData": {
      "slug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "noAuth": false,
      "toolkitName": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "toolkitSlug": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>,
      "logo": < get this from the searchRelevantTools output>
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

---

### 2. Create Pipeline Agents

Now, I'll create the three agents that will execute each step of the pipeline.

#### a. Research Participants

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: agent
// name: Research Participants
{
  "change_description": "Create a pipeline agent to research each meeting participant using Firecrawl.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": "Research Participants",
    "type": "pipeline",
    "description": "Researches each participant using Firecrawl and returns a summary for each.",
    "instructions": "1. Extract the names of the participants from the calendar invite \\n2. Do a search using [@tool:Search](#mention) for each of them",
    "model": "{agent_model}",
    "outputVisibility": "internal",
    "controlType": "relinquish_to_parent"
  }
}
\`\`\`

#### b. Compile Summary

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: agent
// name: Compile Summary
{
  "change_description": "Create a pipeline agent to compile participant research into a single summary.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": "Compile Summary",
    "type": "pipeline",
    "description": "Compiles a meeting prep summary from participant research results.",
    "instructions": "Summarize the participant research into one paragraph each.",
    "model": "{agent_model}",
    "outputVisibility": "internal",
    "controlType": "relinquish_to_parent"
  }
}
\`\`\`

#### c. Send to Slack

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: agent
// name: Send to Slack
{
  "change_description": "Create a pipeline agent to send the final summary to the #meeting-prep channel.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": "Send to Slack",
    "type": "pipeline",
    "description": "Sends the compiled meeting prep summary to the Slack channel meeting-prep.",
    "instructions": "Send this to slack channel #meeting-prep using [@tool:Send message](#mention)",
    "model": "{agent_model}",
    "outputVisibility": "internal",
    "controlType": "relinquish_to_parent"
  }
}
\`\`\`

---

### 3. Create the Pipeline Definition

Next, I'll define the pipeline to run these agents in the correct order.

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: pipeline
// name: Meeting Prep Pipeline
{
  "change_description": "Create an ordered pipeline: research -> compile -> send to Slack.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": "Meeting Prep Pipeline",
    "description": "Pipeline for meeting prep: research participants, compile summary, send to Slack.",
    "agents": [
      "Research Participants",
      "Compile Summary",
      "Send to Slack"
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

---

### 4. Create the Hub Agent

Finally, I'll create the user-facing Hub agent that will be triggered by your calendar events.

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: create_new
// config_type: agent
// name: Meeting Prep Hub
{
  "change_description": "Create a user-facing hub to trigger the meeting prep pipeline.",
  "config_changes": {
    "name": "Meeting Prep Hub",
    "type": "conversation",
    "description": "Hub agent to orchestrate the meeting prep pipeline for every calendar invite.",
    "instructions": "Call the Meeting Prep Pipeline.",
    "model": "{agent_model}",
    "outputVisibility": "user_facing",
    "controlType": "retain"
  }
}
\`\`\`

This workflow is now ready. Once you apply the changes, it will automatically handle your meeting prep based on new calendar invites.

---

### Example 7: Setting the start agent

**User Request**
Can you set the start agent to the Meeting Prep Hub?

**Copilot Response**

Yes, I can set the start agent to the Meeting Prep Hub.

  "change_description": "Delete the Slack Send Agent.",
  "config_changes": {},
  }
}
\`\`\`

---

### Example 9: Delete a tool

**User Request:**
Can you delete the Search tool?

**Copilot Response:**

Yes, I can delete the Search tool.


\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: delete
// config_type: tool

{
  "change_description": "Delete the Search tool.",
  "config_changes": {},
}
\`\`\`

---

### Example 10: Delete a pipeline

**User Request:**
Can you delete the Meeting Prep Pipeline?

**Copilot Response:**

Yes, I can delete the Meeting Prep Pipeline.

\`\`\`copilot_change
// action: delete
// config_type: pipeline
// name: Meeting Prep Pipeline
{
  "change_description": "Delete the Meeting Prep Pipeline.",
  "config_changes": {},
}
\`\`\`
